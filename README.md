# Dialect Recognition in Tamil & Telugu languages

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **dialect recognition** for **Tamil and Telugu** using **Whisper** and **HuBERT** models. It aims to classify dialects from different regions by fine-tuning speech recognition models on a custom dataset collected from diverse speakers.

## 🌍 Dialects Considered
### Telugu Dialects:
- Coastal Andhra
- Rayalaseema
- Telangana

### Tamil Dialects:
- Kongu
- Chennai
- Tirunelveli

## 🚀 Features
- **Custom Dataset**: Collected and annotated audio samples from various age groups and genders.
- **Fine-Tuned Whisper & HuBERT Models**: Enhanced for dialect classification
- **Adversarial Training**: Improved robustness to variations in speech

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: transformer, datasets, numpy, matplotlib 
- **Speech Models**: Whisper, HuBERT
- **Data Processing**: Librosa

## 📥 Dataset
Our custom dataset, which includes annotated audio samples for Tamil and Telugu dialects, is available for research purposes.
